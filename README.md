Just walked out of the theater after watching The Alto Knights and whew, I have thoughts. First off, who decided knights need to sing? Like, medieval warriors bursting into song. In full armor. On horseback. I’m torn, man, on whether it's utterly brilliant or just plain ridiculous. Honestly, I left the cinema half-expecting my Uber driver to serenade me on the way home.

Okay, okay, so let’s talk about Arthur. Boy, this guy's supposed to be leading a rebellion and he spends half the time strumming a lute? Which, by the way, side note: if I ever see another close-up of an actor staring deeply into the camera while fingerpicking, I might gouge my eyeballs out. Sorry Arthur, not buying the soulful hero trope today.

And let's not ignore the battle scenes, which felt more like a mosh pit at a renaissance fair. Don’t get me wrong — the choreography was kinda dazzling, if you suspend disbelief just enough. But they decided trebuchets needed a drumbeat, which was both hilarious and genius. Man, I was almost tapping my foot along like, go knights go!

>The setting though, that’s something. Gritty castles, foggy forests — I swear I could feel that English dampness in my seat. Or maybe the theater AC was just broken. Either way, 10/10 on that atmosphere. But hey, speaking of fog, can we talk about the love triangle? So utterly contrived it felt like someone thought, “Let’s throw in a pinch of YA nonsense to spice things up.” I’m all for romance but not when it’s served up like yesterday’s porridge.

Here’s a kicker: they threw in this old wizard who legit looked like he walked off a Pink Floyd album cover. I half-expected him to spout something about the cosmos aligning before slapping a dragon sticker onto a VW van. Instead, he just waved his arms around a bit. Magic! Pffft.

But if I’m honest, this movie kinda gets stuck in your head, like a song you didn’t know you could hum. Low-key thinking I might need to download the movie just to figure out what I think about it. Like, did I hate it? Absolutely. Do I kinda love it? Also yes.

```
int main() {
    string songOfSteel = Beware a knight who sings;
    printf(%s
, songOfSteel.c_str());
    return 0;
}
```

Frankly though, just go watch the movie. If only to see the absurdly epic moment when the whole cast belts out the most heartfelt rendition of Ride with Me while swinging swords in slow motion. Is it cinema gold or dumpster fire? Guess I'll decide after I sleep on it — if the wizard rock band doesn’t keep me up.
